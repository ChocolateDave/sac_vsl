  abstract  = {Model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been demonstrated on a range of challenging decision making and control tasks. However, these methods typically suffer from two major challenges: very high sample complexity and brittle convergence properties, which necessitate meticulous hyperparameter tuning. Both of these challenges severely limit the applicability of such methods to complex, real-world domains. In this paper, we propose soft actor-critic, an off-policy actor-critic deep RL algorithm based on the maximum entropy reinforcement learning framework. In this framework, the actor aims to maximize expected reward while also maximizing entropy. That is, to succeed at the task while acting as randomly as possible. Prior deep RL methods based on this framework have been formulated as Q-learning methods. By combining off-policy updates with a stable stochastic actor-critic formulation, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of continuous control benchmark tasks, outperforming prior on-policy and off-policy methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in contrast to other off-policy algorithms, our approach is very stable, achieving very similar performance across different random seeds.}

  abstract = {The Markov property of driving cycles was discussed by making a thorough description of their essential characteristics. The Markov chain, a useful tool for designing and expressing driving cycles, has been increasingly used in the field of driving cycles in recent years. Although the Markov property of driving cycles left unproved, some researchers have taken it for granted that it is appropriate to design driving cycle with Markov chain. In our research, the vehicle dynamics model and the car-following model were used to establish the two-dimensional Markov state transition model. On the other hand, the driving data from the city of Changchun were collected to analyze how states (in Markov theory) correlation changes with the increase of time intervals. After the Markov property had been proven, the theory of ergodicity was applied to reveal the relationship between velocity-acceleration joint probability distribution (VA Probability) and state transition matrix. Finally, the application of Markov property was also discussed briefly. This research will lay a theoretical foundation for designing driving cycles and ECO driving (Economical and Ecological).},
